    <p id="H2_2">Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted, ground coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic,
        coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content, but decaffeinated coffee
        is
        also commercially available. There are also various coffee substitutes.</p>

<h2>Brazil</h2>
<p>Brazil produces about a third of the world's coffee, making the country by far the world's largest producer. Coffee
    plantations, covering some 27,000 km2 (10,000 sq mi), are mainly located in the southeastern states of Minas Gerais,
    São Paulo and Paraná where the environment and climate provide ideal growing conditions.

    The crop first arrived in Brazil in the 18th century, and the country had become the dominant producer by the 1840s.
    Brazilian coffee prospered since the early 19th century, when immigrants came to work in the coffee plantations.
    Production as a share of world coffee output peaked in the 1920s but has declined since the 1950s due to increased
    global production.</p>
<h2>Columbia</h2>
<p>Coffee production in Colombia has a reputation for producing mild, well-balanced coffee beans.[1][2][3][4] Colombia's
    average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and
    Vietnam, though highest in terms of the arabica bean.[5][6][7][8] The beans are exported to United States, Germany,
    France, Japan, and Italy.[9] Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region, while other regions
    focus on quality instead of volumes, such as Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. In 2007, the European Union granted
    Colombian coffee a protected designation of origin status.[10] In 2011, UNESCO declared the "Coffee Cultural
    Landscape" of Colombia, a World Heritage site.[11]

    The coffee plant had spread to Colombia by 1790.[12] The oldest written testimony of the presence of coffee in
    Colombia is attributed to a Jesuit priest, José Gumilla. In his book The Orinoco Illustrated (1730), he registered
    the presence of coffee in the mission of Saint Teresa of Tabajé, near where the Meta river empties into the Orinoco.
    Further testimony comes from the archbishop-viceroy Caballero y Gongora (1787) who registered the presence of the
    crop in the north east of the country near Giron (Santander) and Muzo (Boyaca) in a report that he provided to the
    Spanish authorities.</p>
<h2>Ethiopia</h2>
<p>Coffee production in Ethiopia is a longstanding tradition which dates back dozens of centuries. Ethiopia is where
    Coffea arabica, the coffee plant, originates.[1] The plant is now grown in various parts of the world; Ethiopia
    itself accounts for around 17% of the global coffee market. Coffee is important to the economy of Ethiopia; around
    30-35% of foreign income comes from coffee, with an estimated 15 million of the population relying on some aspect of
    coffee production for their livelihood.[1] In 2013, coffee exports brought in $300 million,[2] equivalent to 24% of
    that year's total exports.[3]</p>
<h2>Guatemala</h2>
<p>Coffee production began to develop in Guatemala in the 1850s. Coffee is an important element of Guatemala's
    economy.[1]

    Guatemala was Central America's top producer of coffee for most of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century,
    until being overtaken by Honduras in 2011.[1] Illegal exports to Honduras and Mexico are not reflected in official
    statistics.[2]</p>
<h2>Kenya</h2>
<p>Coffee production is a significant contributor to the economy of Kenya.[1] The industry is noted for its cooperative
    system of production, processing, milling, marketing, and auction system. About 70% of Kenyan coffee is produced in
    small farms that control about 75% of the land under production.[2][3] It was estimated in 2012 that there were
    about 150,000 coffee farmers in Kenya.[4] Other sources suggest that 6 million Kenyans are employed directly or
    indirectly in the coffee industry.[5]

    The acidic soil in the highlands of central Kenya together with just the right amount of sunlight and rainfall
    provide excellent conditions for growing coffee plants. However, due to a property boom in areas that grow coffee
    and price instability,[6][4] production in this African Great Lakes country fell from about 130,000 tonnes in 1987/8
    to 40,000 tonnes in 2011/12.[7]

    Kenya largely produces Arabica blend coffee.[8] Coffee from Kenya is of the 'Colombia mild' type, and is well known
    for its intense flavor, full body, and pleasant aroma with notes of cocoa, high grade coffee from Kenya is one of
    the most sought-after coffees in the world.[4]</p>
