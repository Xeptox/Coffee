        <p id="intro-text">Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted, ground coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and
            slightly
            acidic,
            coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content, but decaffeinated coffee
            is
            also commercially available. There are also various coffee substitutes.</p>

        <div class="about-main">
            <p class="about_coffee_txt">Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the
                production;
                robusta accounts for the
                remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing cluster of states led
                by Rio
                where arabica is
                produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of
                Espirito Santo
                where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.

                worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta.
                Probably the
                most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is S.795.</p>

            <p class="about_coffee_txt">Ethiopian beans can be divided into 3 categories: Longberry, Shortberry,

                Longberry
                varieties consist of
                the largest beans and are often considered of the highest quality in both value and flavor.
                Shortberry varieties are
                smaller. The Mocha variety is a highly prized commodity. Mocha Harars are known for their
                peaberry
                beans that often
                have complex chocolate, spice and citrus notes.</p>

                type, and is well known for its
                intense flavor, full body, and pleasant aroma with notes of cocoa and high grade
