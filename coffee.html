        <p class="col-12 col-sm-6 mx-5 text-center align-self-center">Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted,
            ground coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect
            on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content, but decaffeinated coffee is also commercially
            available. There are also various coffee substitutes.</p>

            <p class="par text-center mb-5 ">Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of
                the
                production; robusta accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main
                coffee-growing cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is produced almost exclusively. Robusta is
                primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of Espirito S/anto where about 80% of the coffee
                is robusta.

                beans.Colombia's average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest

                India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is
                defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its
                worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and
                Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is S.795.</p>

            <p class="par text-center mb-5 ">Ethiopian beans can be divided into 3 categories: Longberry,
                Shortberry, and Mocha. Longberry varieties consist of the largest beans and are often considered
                of the highest quality in both value and flavor. Shortberry varieties are smaller. The Mocha
                variety is a highly prized commodity. Mocha Harars are known for their peaberry beans that often
                have complex chocolate, spice and citrus notes.</p>
